# Intro_to_stats_learning
Studying statistical concepts as they apply to statistical learning

Following along with the text Introduction to Statistical Learning (http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/data.html). Code contained in this repository is being used solely for studying.

Chapter 1: intro
Chapter 2: statistical learning
Chapter 3: linear regression
Chapter 4: classification
Chapter 5: resampling methods
Chapter 6: linear model selection and regularization
Chapter 7: moving beyond linearity
Chapter 8: tree-based methods
Chapter 9: support vector machines
Chapter 10: unsupervised learning

Many of the examples in the text do not contain R code. I thought it was equally important to create the R code used to reproduce the examples as it is to understand the concepts behind the learnings. This also adds more complexity to the labs contained in the text, which are on the introductory side.
